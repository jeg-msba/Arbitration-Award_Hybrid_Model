# Evaluating Major League Baseball Arbitration Awards Using a Hybrid Learning Model
## Clustering and Linear Regression Analysis

This study used clustering and linear regression analysis to help us understand if the arbitration process results in players with limited leverage (can only negotiate with one team) are 
paid similarly to players who already reached free agent status (can negotiate with any team).
